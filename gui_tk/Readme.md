main function: ruby_calc.rb
a simpler way to creat calculators: call_calc.rb
reference: folder 'homework of ...'
test files: folder 'temp files ...' 

This is a calcutor wirtten in ruby with the help of tk. and it's also
the homework for my ruby class. But sincerely I don't know 
much about ruby tcl/tk. It took me great pain to find some tutorials.

While writing this calculator, I took the reference from seniors. You
can find source codes in the folder 'homework of seniors --for reference'.

You will think the calculator simple and crude. That's right, because 
I don't konw how to make it better.

I'm still trying to add new functions to it and make it look better in the 
future.

By the way, I love yae sakura forever.
